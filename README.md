**Overview:**
For this midterm biometrics project, I was required to implement a Manhattan verifier and report the **impostor pass rate and false reject rates** for the first 200 samples of each user in this keystroke biometrics dataset.

**Data Set:**
This is a data set of keystroke-timing information from 51 subjects.

**Tasks:**
Determined the template mean using key hold and key interval times using the first N samples when N = 100, 200, and 300. 
Compute the genuine and impostor scores, using the Manhattan distance
Calculate the impostor pass and false reject rates for a given threshold, T = .255, 8.848, 17.442, 26.036, and 34.630
Calculate the false accpet rate at 0 when N = 100, 200, and 300
